                <p class="post-excerpt">
                    As my first term of the Computing and Financial Management program at the University of Waterloo came to an end, 
                    I’ve taken some time to look back at the last 4 months and think about important things I’ve learned. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>1. You are capable of doing so much more than you think you can.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    THIS has got to be one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned and internalized over the last 4 months. During the first semester, I was faced with many academic challenges that I didn’t believe I could overcome. I felt especially hopeless when it came to solving math problems from our weekly assignments that looked absolutely impossible. But there was no other option other than to do everything I could to solve as much of the problem as possible. 
                    <br><br>
                    On Mondays when assignments were released, I would read over the questions and feel dread. Yet as I worked on the questions bit by bit each day, I would slowly make progress and feel my excitement grow as I neared a solution. Most of the time, a problem that initially seemed impossible would become solvable. 
                    <br><br>
                    By the last few weeks of the first term, I felt less dread and uncertainty when tackling difficult problems. I had increased confidence in myself and knew that even if a question seemed impossible at first, all I had to do was calm my mind down and try to take the first small step. 
                    <br><br>
         
                    <b>2. Create structure in an unstructured world.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Due to having asynchronous online classes, my default schedule was very unstructured and I relied heavily on self-discipline to maintain structure in my day-to-day life. As much as I enjoy spontaneity and ‘going with the flow’, I personally find structure to be an important backbone in maintaining my life. In the first half of the term, my sleep schedule had completely fallen apart, sleeping at 3 or 4am most nights. This was a big change given that I slept religiously at 11pm as a high schooler. To restore some order back into my life, I set a hard rule to sleep before 2am and I preplanned my weeks by allocating my weekly tasks in a spread out manner. To be honest, I only followed my rule and preplanned my weeks about 60% of the time, but I am working on improving my success rate in the next semester. 
                    <br><br>

                    <b>3. Keeping in touch with family is important.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    It’s very easy to get caught up in your own world when experiencing a completely new environment such as university. Part of what keeps me grounded is feeling grateful for my family that supported me throughout my journey to get to where I am today. Calling them on a weekly basis to update them about university life was one of my personal goals. 
                    <br><br>
                    The pandemic caused the world to slow down and made me appreciate my family much more for everything they’ve done for me. I also came across an eye-opening article written by Tim Urban about how you spend the majority of the time you’ll ever get with your parents by the time you’re 18. As a result, I’ve been trying to be more intentional with family time after moving out. 
                    <br><br>
                    Those were 3 out of many lessons that I’ve learned over my first 4 months in university. Although it has been challenging, the fun comes with overcoming the struggle.
